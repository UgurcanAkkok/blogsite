# Uğurcan Akkök

I am a computer engineering student, studying at [Bahcesehir University](https://bau.edu.tr). I am very passionate about 
programming and software in general. You can take a look at which projects i am working on at my 
[github](https://github.com/ugurcanakkok) page. My interests are changing fast but i try to focus them on one or two
points to be able to improve myself better on the certain topics.

I believe in free society and human rights, which [FSF, Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org) firmly supports it 
with all its heart. Free (as in freedom) software will not only protect its user's rights but also will focus on being
beneficial to everybody.

I support [Open Source Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement) as i think it will create better
software and give people some crucial rights to modify it, study it and share it.

Linux and Unix-like operating systems are interesting to me as they are one of the greatest projects that are 
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and it encourages user to understand the system so
that you will have more control over it. That leads to Linux being very efficient system when you want to create software.

I like to read inspiring philosophical ideas, it encourages me to improve myself. Some of the philosophers that i found
worth reading are  

* Marcus Aurelius
* Nietzsche
* Seneca
* Epictetus
