      <description>Uğurcan Akkök I am a computer engineering student, studying at Bahcesehir University. I am very passionate about programming and software in general. You can take a look at which projects i am working on at my github page. My interests are changing fast but i try to focus them on one or two points to be able to improve myself better on the certain topics.
I believe in free society and human rights, which FSF, Free Software Foundation firmly supports it with all its heart.</description>
